# AgentP-Doofendash-Reborn
This is a preservation / restoration effort for a relatively obscure mobile game I used to play, but was delisted in 2015 and was unplayable on modern hardware. I have ported it from Unity 4 to Unity 2022 and made the needed changes to get it working well on a modern phone, or other platforms if you want.

**Why are you spending the time and effort to restore a 13 year old mobile game very few people care about?**

Because I want to and I'm having fun

This game is now playable with a WebGL build! It's basic but it gets the job done for now.

**Current known issues:**

- The alternative models for Perry are a bit messed up.

- Shaders are not perfectly accurate, they're close but not perfect.

- Some menus / buttons softlock the game, everything needed for the main gameplay works fine.

- UI scaling is wrong on modern devices, it's usable but definitely inconsistent and a bit funky. I am very open to suggestions on what to do about this without redoing the entire UI.
