This is a preservation / restoration effort for a relatively obscure mobile game I used to play, but was delisted in 2015 and was unplayable on modern hardware. I have ported it from Unity 4 to Unity 2022 and made the needed changes to get it working well on a modern phone, or other platforms if you want.

Current known issues:
Occasionally the game will fail to start the gameplay when you press start, this is a nullreference but I can't figure out what is causing it and it's not super common.

The alternative models for Perry are messed up.

Shaders are not perfectly accurate.
