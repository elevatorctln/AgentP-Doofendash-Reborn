_GAME_INTRO_FIRST_TIME_
Doofensmirtz has been buying up all the rooftop real estate. It sounds like he is constructing an evil plan.  Investigate at once!
_GAME_INTROB_FIRST_TIME_
But, enough of the frivolity. Doofenshmirtz is terrorizing the Tri-State area! They have weapons and traps, and knee-high obstructions and... well you can probably fill in the rest of the details yourself. Get out there and put a stop to 'em!
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_1_
Don't forget to shop so you don't drop, Agent. See what I did there?
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_2_
Want to fight back? Don't forget to buy Gadgets from the shop.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_3_
The OWCA is not in the best place, financially, I'm afraid. We made some bad investments. Carl was sure pogs would make a comeback. Unfortunately this means you'll have to cover the costs for your own gadgets for now.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_4_
Did Carl remember to tell you to buy a gadget? If not, the only way to defeat Doofenshmirtz is with our nifty new gadget tech. It's in the shop.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_5_
I hear Doofenshmirtz got himself a new vehicle. If his failure at the Drusselstein driving test is any indicator, we're probably in trouble. Go put the brakes on him.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_6_
Ha! I just thought of this one time you had to wear a coconut bra. Great googly moogly that was hilarious.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_7_
While you were out there agenting, Carl and I whipped up some new upgrades in the shop. Go check them out.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_8_
Have you met Agent E? You know, the eagle. If not, you should give him a call from the upgrades shop and see if he can help you out.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_9_
Woah, Carl just got back from the strangest convention. Have you heard of this Ducky Momo? Carl, brought back a con exclusive and put him in the shop for you to check out.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_10_
Agent, if you're looking to move up the ranks, make sure you complete your mission objectives. Get a promotion and earn more points.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_11_
Agent, Carl spent a real long time at the sewing machine last night and wanted to make sure you saw his handiwork. Have you tried out one of his costumes?
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_12_
Need a headstart? Get a Copter Jump Start from the shop.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_13_
Don't let Doofenshmirtz get you down, get the gadgets from the shop and fight back against evil.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_14_
Whoa, did you see that? I swear I just saw a floating baby head. Carl, catch that head and put it in the shop!
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_15_
Looks like Pinky had a rough day of playing dress-up. Our very own Princess Pinky is now available to battle evil.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_16_
Did you hear? Doofenshmirtz bought up every last spherical hovering machine. We might be in for a long battle. Who knows how many the Evil Science Emporium had!
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_17_
Carl! Where's my bowler and bow tie? Did you give it to Peter the Panda again?
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_18_
If you want to continue your quest to squash the evilest of evil, keep some fedoras on hand to continue your chase.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_19_
Doofenshmirtz seems to have entered into Danville's annual Soap Box Derby. I know that doesn't sound evil but the age limit for the competition is 11 years old. Get out there and put the brakes on his nefarious plans.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_20_
Our sources say Doofenshmirtz bought 1000's of Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated stickers. Either he's starting a band or has an evil scheme in the works.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_21_
It seems Doofenshmirtz has stolen all the caution signs from the newly constructed soon to be abandoned old amusement park. Find out what he's up to.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_22_
Doofenshmirtz has been buying up all the pet carriers in Danville. This can only mean truly nefarious schemes are being hatched. Go stop him.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_23_
Our sources say Doofenshmirtz bought a hammer. Not sure why, but I don't trust him. Check it out.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_24_
Doofenshmirtz has been buying all the buttons from the big red button shop. This can only be for evil.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_25_
Doofenshmirtz has created a eucalyptusinator and now everyone below the 15th floor has become a Koala. Stay out of that gas cloud and stop Doofenshmirtz before we get too cuddly.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_26_
Our sources say Doofenshmirtz has been buying up all the hoses in Danville a most evil scheme indeed. How am I going to water my gardenias? I need you to investigate it.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_27_
Doofenshmirtz has been sighted in some kind of floating orb. I'm not sure what this means, but it sounds dangerous. Get out there and stop him.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_28_
It seems Doofenshmirtz has decided one purple building in the center of town isn't enough and he's expanding throughout all of downtown Danville. I'm sure you'll have no problem making it through the construction.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_29_
Doofenshmirtz seems to have created some kind of wooden plankinator and gathered them all on the rooftop. Either he's trying to recruit all the termites in the city or it's some kind of evil expansion scheme. I need you to investigate it.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_30_
Carl, what did you say you heard about Doofenshmirtz? Oh yeah. Doofenshmirtz seems to be buying up all the lighter fluid in the city and now Slushy Burger can't flame broil my lunch. Get out there and stop him.
_GAME_INTRO_TIP_31_
Agent, I've got some bad news. Doofenshmirtz seems to have upgraded his Evil Dirigible and has been spotted in the sky above Danville. Take to the roofs and stop him.
_MONO_MISSION_TIP_1_
I had Carl put together some missions for you while you're out there fighting evil. Also, if you pass a grocery store, we could use some more milk.
_MONO_MISSION_TIP_2_
Look, I know you’ve got your hands full, but we could really use that milk. This cereal is  surprisingly dry. Carl tried adding water and well, it didn’t exactly work out…
_MONO_MISSION_TIP_3_
Agent P, don’t forget to complete these arbitrary—er, I mean, totally important and necessary missions while you’re out there fighting evil.
_MONO_MISSION_TIP_4_
Agent Pinky, don’t forget to complete these arbitrary—er, I mean, totally important and necessary missions while you’re out there fighting evil.
_MONO_MISSION_TIP_5_
Agent T, don’t forget to complete these arbitrary—er, I mean, totally important and necessary missions while you’re out there fighting evil.
_MONO_MISSION_TIP_6_
Carl, I thought we agreed Disco Dancing would be on the list? Well, go ahead and do these other missions anyway, agent.
_MONO_MISSION_TIP_7_
Good luck out there, Agent!
_MONO_MISSION_TIP_8_
Carl and I are busy working on some new missions. How's this sound: Defeat Doofenshmirtz while standing on your head, whistling Take Me Out to the Ball Game, and wearing a pink tutu? Too much?
_MONO_MISSION_TIP_9_
You know, Carl and I worked really hard on these Missions. I'll try not to be hurt that you've decided to ignore them.
_MONO_MISSION_TIP_10_
Agent, I hope you haven't forgot about these missions! If you complete them Carl gets a bonus, doubling his salary! Of course, his salary is zero, so double that would still be zero...but, it's the principal of the thing…
_MONO_MISSION_TIP_11_
Well, if you're not going to complete any of these Missions, could you at least pick up the milk. Dry cereal is worse than no cereal at all!
_MONO_MISSION_TIP_12_
Congratulations! I’m pretty sure this mission was a typo, though. Oh well, good job nonetheless.
_MONO_MISSION_TIP_13_
Now if you could hurry up with that milk…Carl just scratched the roof of his mouth trying to eat dry cereal…
